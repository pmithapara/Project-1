			<h3><strong>About One Piece</strong></h3>
			  <p>One Piece is a japanese based manga series which is later on converted into an anime. This series is written and drawn by Eiichiro Oda and it started back in July 22, 1997 till present. This is, accoriding to my knowledge, one of the best and the longest anime which had been delivering good contant without stopping for so many years. So far, there are more than 900 chapters into this story. This manga is about a ship crew (Nakama in japanese), who are sailing out to the sea to conquer the world.</p>
